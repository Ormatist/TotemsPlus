- Optifine Custom Item Textures (OFCIT) *(Legacy)*

  This allows for you to rename a totem in an anvil and have its texture change. This intergration exsists as it is purely client side (just a texture pack) so no world/server install is required. However it should be noted that we've moved it into a legacy state meaning it will recive no major updates or new features for the forseeable future. Addintionaly Optifine is manditory for this install or it wont work. You can download the latset version of optifine from its official website here: https://optifine.net/downloads
- Minecraft Custom Model Data (MCCMD)

  This allows for a fully immersive experience were your custom totems are dropped by the evoker with custom weighting, names, lore and more. This integration is both client and world side requiring both a datapack and texture pack to use. This is the intergration we actively work on maintaining and creating more content and features for.
  
In addition to these integrations we also have many experimental features planned witch will eventually optionally fall under to the MCCMD intergration (#7, #10, #11, #13)

These 2 integrations can be selected by toggling the by deafult "gold" button (which is a dark teal if MCCMD is selected). Whichever intergration is selected when the "Compile" button is pressed will be chosen.

Next You will need to upload your totem files. We currently except the ".jpg , .png , .tga" file formats as that is what is compatible with Minecraft (We are also working on providing animated or ".gif" support in the future (#12)). We reccommend having all your totems in one place/folder and selecting them all for upload at once.

Finally select the version of Minecraft you wish to create your packs for, we currently supports all versions from 1.14

After you've uploaded all your files, selected your integration type and chosen your version hit the "compile" button to progress

You first totem texture will appear in the top right of the OFCIT popup and you will be prompted to enter a rename name. This is the string you will rename the totem to in an anvil to change its texture.

In this example i may enter "Totem Of Mumbo"

Once you've entered your string hit the "next" button and your next totem will be displayed. Enter the string you wish this to be renamed to and hit next again. The process will repeat until all of your totem textures have been cycled through.

Finally you will recive a popup notifing you that your pack creation process is finished. Hitting the "Ok" button will close the Totems+ Software.

It's time to boot up minecraft and give it a test!

On your minecraft resource pack tap you should notice a new "Totems+ OFCIT" resource pack. Apply it to your client (seen above) and load into any world/server

# MCCMD

The integration begins by prompting you to select a world from your minecraft saves folder. Select the world you wish to create the datapack for and hit confirm.

Additionally there are also some other general options you can customise before you proceed including:
- Rolls (Number of Totems dropped per kill)
- Bonus Rolls (Number of extra possible rolls per kill)
- The option to include the original totem in the loot table
- The option to adjust the weighting of the original totem (lower = more rare, higher = less rare)

Next the program will cycle through the selected totem textures where for each you can customise the following:
- Name

  The name of the totem. You can also toggle if this name shows in game or not
  
- Weight

  The weighting of the totem in the loot tabel (lower = more rare, higher = less rare).
  
- Lore

  The lore of the totem. You can also toggle if this lore shows in game or not
  
Furthermore you can also toggle the option to generate your custom Documentation which will look something a little like this:

And you can also generate custom functions to make accessing your custom totems easier:

By deafult these options are selected however you can allways toggle them off.

Finally you will recive a popup notifing you that your pack creation process is finished. Hitting the "Ok" button will close the Totems+ Software.

Load up your minecraft world you selected earlier and apply the resource pack

To test it out just kill an evoker or if you've generated functions run a function and BOOM custom totems in minecraft
