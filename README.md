Once you've started Totems+ you will first need to select an integration type. Totems Plus currently supports 2 integration types:

- Optifine Custom Item Textures (OFCIT) *(Legacy)*

  This allows for you to rename a totem in an anvil and have its texture change. This intergration exsists as it is purely client side (just a texture pack) so no world/server install is required. However it should be noted that we've moved it into a legacy state meaning it will recive no major updates or new features for the forseeable future. Addintionaly Optifine is manditory for this install or it wont work. You can download the latset version of optifine from its official website here: https://optifine.net/downloads
- Minecraft Custom Model Data (MCCMD)

  This allows for a fully immersive experience were your custom totems are dropped by the evoker with custom weighting, names, lore and more. This integration is both client and world side requiring both a datapack and texture pack to use. This is the intergration we actively work on maintaining and creating more content and features for.
  
In addition to these integrations we also have many experimental features planned witch will eventually optionally fall under to the MCCMD intergration (#7, #10, #11, #13)

These 2 integrations can be selected by toggling the by deafult "gold" button (which is a dark teal if MCCMD is selected). Whichever intergration is selected when the "Compile" button is pressed will be chosen.

Next You will need to upload your totem files. We currently except the ".jpg , .png , .tga" file formats as that is what is compatible with Minecraft (We are also working on providing animated or ".gif" support in the future (#12)). We reccommend having all your totems in one place/folder and selecting them all for upload at once.

After you've uploaded all your files and selected your integration type hit the "compile" button to progress

You first totem textur will appear in the top right of the OFCIT popup and you will be prompted to enter a rename name. This is the string you will rename the totem to in an anvil to change its texture.

In this example i may enter "Totem Of Mumbo"

Once you've entered your string hit the "next" button and your next totem will be displayed. Enter the string you wish this to be renamed to and hit next again. The process will repeat until all of your totem textures have been cycled through.

Finally you will recive a popup notifing you that your pack creation process is finished. Hitting the "Ok" button will close the Totems+ Software.

It's time to boot up minecraft and give it a test!

On your minecraft resource pack tap you should notice a new "Totems+ OFCIT" resource pack. Apply it to your client (seen above) and load into any world/server
